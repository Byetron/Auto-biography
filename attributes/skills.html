            My skills today may seem basic from the outside — HTML, Python, version control, the start of a grasp on AI and machine learning — but to me, they’re so much more. They’re hours I wrestled with imposter syndrome. They’re nights spent debugging when I could’ve given up. They’re proof that even in the absence of talent, persistence matters. And these skills are still growing, just like I am.

            I’m not the polished product of a perfect academic career; I’m a work-in-progress stitched together from failure, curiosity, and an unshakable desire to understand how the world works — and more importantly, why it works the way it does. Alongside all this, I discovered HTML — the language that let me bring thoughts and ideas onto the screen. Even if it's simple, building this website with just HTML means a lot to me. Every tag and every element here is something I wrote with intention.

            I may not be a master in any single domain yet, but I’m becoming fluent in the languages that build the digital world. What matters more is that I’m no longer just a consumer of code — I’m slowly becoming a creator. My journey is still unfolding, but each line I write gets me one step closer to the version of myself I’ve always wanted to become.
