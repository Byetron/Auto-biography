        <h2><b>The Downfall in Academics</b></h2>

        <section>
            I began my schooling at B.P. Indian Public School, where I studied from Lower Kindergarten all the way through 10th grade under the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) board. My time there laid the foundation for my academic inclinations and instilled in me an early sense of discipline and structure. ICSE’s broad-based curriculum, known for its emphasis on English and application-based learning, helped me develop strong written communication skills and a firm grasp on subjects like Mathematics and Science. I graduated with a commendable 82% in my board exams, proud of the effort I had put in, and eager to push forward.

            After school, I transitioned into a very different academic culture at Sri Chaitanya PU College, where I pursued my 11th and 12th grades under the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). These two years were intense, shaped by the highly competitive environment and exam-driven teaching style that Chaitanya is known for. Although the experience was demanding and often exhausting, it taught me the value of endurance and strategy in academics. I graduated with a 73%, which, while modest on paper, reflected the perseverance I showed in a system that often prioritizes outcome over individual learning styles.

            I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at MS Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences (MSRUAS), specializing in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. My academic journey here has been transformative—not just in terms of what I’ve learned technically, but also in how I’ve grown intellectually and personally. Despite setbacks in the early semesters that impacted my confidence and performance, I gradually found my footing again. Through consistent effort, self-reflection, and a growing curiosity for AI, I’ve managed to bring my cumulative CGPA up to 7.4. More than just a number, this score represents resilience—the ability to recover from academic failures and keep striving to understand and create.
