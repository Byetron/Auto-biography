        <section>
            This isn’t a grand achievement. It’s not flashy, and it won’t win any awards. But for me, this website means more than just a working layout or some functioning code. It’s proof that I’m still here—still learning, still trying, still refusing to stay down, even after everything.

        <section>
            I’ve failed more times than I can count. In exams, in projects, in things I once believed I was good at. I’ve sat staring at blank screens for hours, too overwhelmed to start, and I’ve walked into exams knowing full well I wasn’t prepared. I’ve watched my peers push ahead—securing internships, mastering skills, building portfolios—while I stayed behind, stuck in this limbo where progress felt like a distant concept. And in all that, I didn’t just doubt my skills; I doubted myself. There were days I genuinely believed I didn’t belong here, that I was fooling myself by even trying to keep up.

            People talk about perseverance like it’s heroic, but truthfully, mine wasn’t. It wasn’t loud or inspirational. It was messy and quiet. It looked like crying after failing a subject and still showing up the next day. It looked like opening a project weeks after abandoning it, just to see if it still made sense. It looked like writing “hello world” for the hundredth time—not to impress anyone, but just to remind myself I could still write something.

            So, this website? It’s not a showcase of my best work. It’s a testament to the fact that I didn’t give up. It’s a reminder that even when everything felt like it was falling apart, I kept going. I built this not because I wanted to impress anyone, but because I needed to prove to myself that I could. That I could create something, even if it wasn’t perfect.
        </section>

        <section>
            This website is my beginning. Not some cinematic, glorious breakthrough—just a real, human one. A calm, stubborn refusal to give up. If you’re here reading this, know that every part of this was earned: through uncertainty, through silence, through hours of doubt and days of nothing. And somehow, through all that, I’m still building.
