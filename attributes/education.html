        <h2><b>The Educational Run</b></h2>

        <section>
            I’m a Computer Science and Engineering student, currently specializing in Artificial Intelligence — but those labels only tell a fraction of my story. The truth is, this journey hasn’t been smooth, easy, or even remotely predictable. I’ve stumbled through it all: failed subjects, missed opportunities, self-doubt that could eat through steel. There were semesters where everything felt like it was slipping through my fingers, where even the smallest tasks felt insurmountable. I remember staring at screens for hours, unable to write even a single working line of code, wondering if I was just pretending to belong in this field. But I kept showing up. Kept trying. Kept failing — and learning from it. Building this website, my very first, feels like reclaiming something that was taken from me by fear: the courage to keep going.

            My skills today may seem basic from the outside — HTML, Python, version control, the start of a grasp on AI and machine learning — but to me, they’re so much more. They’re hours I wrestled with imposter syndrome. They’re nights spent debugging when I could’ve given up. They’re proof that even in the absence of talent, persistence matters. And these skills are still growing, just like I am. I’m not the polished product of a perfect academic career; I’m a work-in-progress stitched together from failure, curiosity, and an unshakable desire to understand how the world works — and more importantly, why it works the way it does.

            That’s where philosophy comes in — the other side of who I am. Even before I learned to code, I was questioning everything. I’ve always been drawn to the abstract, to the grey areas most people avoid. The nature of the self, the illusion of time, the ethics of control, the fragility of meaning — these are the landscapes my mind naturally drifts to. I don’t believe in easy answers or rigid systems. I believe in contradiction. I believe in tension — not as something to resolve, but to live through. Philosophy taught me that understanding isn't about mastering facts; it's about learning how to live inside questions. And maybe that’s why tech excites me — because it’s a playground where logic meets uncertainty, and I get to build things that reflect both.

            This website, then, isn’t just a project. It’s a map of my failures, stitched with code and clarity. It’s the quiet scream of someone who kept going, even when no one was watching. It’s the first brick in a foundation I’m still laying, and a tribute to the mess that made me.
