            <section>Konnichiwa! I'm Adhya D.  
            <br>Computer Science Student | AIML & Philosophy Enthusiast. Welcome to my space. I’m someone who doesn’t just code—I question. I’m fascinated by the interplay between logic and intuition, between algorithms and the human condition. Whether I’m exploring neural networks or pondering the nature of time, my goal is the same: to understand, to create, and to connect.</section>

            <section>My journey blends computer science with philosophical curiosity. I’m especially drawn to how artificial intelligence can be used in healthcare—not just to solve problems, but to rethink the way we understand care, ethics, and intelligence itself.  
            <br>This portfolio is a collection of that journey: the projects I’ve built, the ideas I’ve wrestled with, and the skills I continue to sharpen.</section>

            <section>Take a look around. You’ll find both code and contemplation here.</section>

            <h4><i>“In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity” - Sun Tzu</i></h4>

            <section>This isn’t just code. This is a milestone. After stumbling through lines of logic, failed compilations, and moments where I questioned whether I belonged in tech at all — this website is my proof that I kept going. It may look simple to someone else, but to me, it's a quiet rebellion against every doubt I’ve ever had.</section>

            <section>There were times I couldn’t even get a basic script to run, let alone design something of my own. I’ve failed exams, lost momentum, and fallen behind when it felt like everyone else was moving forward. But somehow, here I am. Writing this. On a site I built with my own hands.</section>

            <section>I didn’t just learn how to use HTML or create a layout — I learned what persistence feels like. I learned that progress doesn’t always show up as perfect code or clean designs. Sometimes, it shows up as trying again after the 20th time. So no, this isn’t just a homepage. It’s a beginning. And I’m proud of it.</section>

            <section>Thank you for being part of this journey. I hope you find something here that resonates with you, whether it’s a project, an idea, or just the fact that someone else is out there, figuring it all out one line at a time.</section>

            <h3>Becoming still</h3>       
        <section>
            It took a lot for me to even begin something like this. There were moments where I convinced myself it wasn’t worth it, that it wouldn’t be “good enough” to matter. But I’ve come to realise that waiting for perfect conditions is just another form of avoidance. So I started where I was, with the skills I had, and built something small that speaks louder than silence. This site is personal — not in the way that tells you everything about me, but in the way that shows you I’m trying. Trying to move forward. Trying to make sense of things. Trying to create something that reflects both who I am now and who I’m becoming.

            It’s easy to feel invisible when your path hasn’t been straightforward. But in building this, I’ve found a kind of visibility that doesn’t rely on achievements alone — one rooted in honesty, effort, and the quiet discipline of showing up. I don’t know where exactly this road will lead, but I’m no longer afraid to walk it. If this site stands for anything, it’s that beginnings don’t need permission. They just need action. And this — this is mine.
